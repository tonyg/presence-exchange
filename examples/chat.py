# This is an example of the use of the RabbitMQ presence_exchange
# plugin, which adds a new 'x-presence' exchange type to the system.
#
# Two exchanges are created:
#
#  - 'presence.demo.chat.presence', which is an x-presence exchange
#    used to track who is "in the chat room"; and
#
#  - 'presence.demo.chat.messages', which is a fanout exchange used
#    for relaying messages between the current members of the "room".
#
# See ChatSession.on_queue_declared for the fine detail of how to use
# the exchanges for this kind of application.
#
# If the broker is shut down, this program attempts to reconnect. If a
# connection attempt fails, it sleeps for one second and tries again.
